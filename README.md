# KICAD_Parts
I've been having to create a large number of footprints, schematics, and other KICAD specific parts recently. 
I am more than willing to share the product of my work to encourage others to do the same. Please take these 
files and do something useful with them!

Organization:

Footprints - This folder contains footprint files, it is sub-divided where appropriate. The new KICAD style puts each footprint 
in it's own file, where previously they would be stuffed together in a library. This should make updating and upgrading these 
files much easier from my point of view as well as other maintainers.

Schematics - Obviously contains schematic symbols, my understanding is that all of these files are combined into a single .mod file, 
this may make updating and upgrading difficult, perhaps the KICAD maintainers will change this in the future, but for the moment I 
will stick with this convention, possibly breaking the files up as needed.
